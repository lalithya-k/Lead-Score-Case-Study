# Lead-Score-Case-Study
### README: Lead Scoring Case Study

#### Project Overview
This project aims to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score (0-100) to potential customers of X Education. The model predicts the likelihood of a lead converting into a paying customer, helping the sales team focus on high-potential leads.

#### Goals
- Predict lead conversion probability using logistic regression.
- Assign lead scores to optimize the company's lead nurturing and conversion process.
- Achieve a target lead conversion rate of 80%.

#### Project Structure
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and preprocess data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand trends and patterns in lead behavior.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transform and select relevant features for modeling.
4. **Model Building**: Train a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. **Lead Scoring**: Use the model to generate lead scores and prioritize leads.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

#### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `lead_scoring.ipynb` notebook to train the model and generate lead scores.

#### Results
The model outputs a lead score between 92%, helping X Education identify high-priority leads with a higher likelihood of conversion.
